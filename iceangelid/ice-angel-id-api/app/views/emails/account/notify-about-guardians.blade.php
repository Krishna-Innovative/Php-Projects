    Dear {{ $account }},
</p>

<p>
    You are strongly advised to nominate at least one account guardian to administer your dependent members in event of
    you being incapacitated.
</p>

<p>
    You may add a primary guardian and a secondary guardian as an alternate. If we are notified by a third party that
    you have been incapacitated, we will verify this information with your primary guardian failing which, your
    secondary guardian before transferring your members to their account.
</p>

<p>
    You may select one or more of your linked Emergency Contact Person to be your account guardian, or you can nominate
    someone else. If you choose someone else, then the nominated account guardian must be at least 18 years old and is
    required to register as an iCE Account Holder.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,<br/>

    iCE Angel - ID
